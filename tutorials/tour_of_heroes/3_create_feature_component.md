# Create feature component

So far everything is living within `HeroesComponent`
- displaying the list
- viewing the detail

For larger projects, this would be hard to maintain.

> This section splits up large components to smaller specified subcomponents.
> This will ends up with
> 1. `HeroDetailComponent` present the details of a selected hero
> 2. `HeroesComponent` presenting the list
