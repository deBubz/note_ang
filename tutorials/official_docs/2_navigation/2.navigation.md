# Adding navigation

So youll learn
- type in URL in address bar to navigate to product page
- click links on page to navigate in your spa
- click back to nav through history

## Doing the URL path with a component

> app already using ng `routing`

This shows how to define a route to show individual product details

1. Generate new component `product-details`
2. set route in `app.module.ts` for production details with the path for `products/:productid`
3. work on `product-list.component.html`
4. modify anchor to include a `routerLink` with product id as parameter

> `RouterLink` directive help customize anchor element > this case the route / UR:

5. verify it works 

## View Product Detail

> now we messing with the `ProductDetailsComponent` to handle displaying the product

1. in `component.ts` import `ActivatedRoutes` from `@angular/router` and the product array
2. define `product` prop
3. inject `ActivatedRoute` in the `constructor()` by adding `private route: ActivatedRoute` as an arg for the constructor
> `ActivatedRoutes` is specific to each component that angular loads. It contains info about the route and its parameters
>
> the injection configure the component to use a service [more detail - managing data](https://angular.io/start/start-data)
4. extract the product in `ngOnInit()` by matching the corresponding id
