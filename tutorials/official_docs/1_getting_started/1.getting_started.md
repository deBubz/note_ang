## sample application

An angular app is consist of components.

Components defines areas of responsibility in the UI that let you reuse sets of UI functionality

A component has 3 things
- component class - handle data and functionality
- html template - determines the UI
- component specific style - define look and feel

## create sample project

telling us to use web base ide with a pre-made template

## create product list

Ok so we updating the product list, using the predefined data from `products.ts`

1. go in template file `product-list.component.html`
2. add `*ngFor` structural directive in a div
> this repeats for each product in list
>
> structural directives shapes DOM structure by manipulating elements
3. inside the directive, add more tags to interpolate product name, rendering value as text
4. make each product name link to a detail add `<a>` link
5. set the title to be the products name using the property binding `[]`
6. add an id directive to output a `<p>` element if it has a description
7. add button for users to share product. binding `click` event to the `share` method in `product-list/components.ts` 
   - event binding uses `()` around the event
   - `(click)`

## pass data to a child component

currently the list displays name and description of each product
`ProductListComponent` also defines `products`

next step is to create new alert features that uses product data from `ProductListComponent`
- this checks the price
- if > 700
- displays **Notify me** button to let users sign up for notification when its on sale

> This goes through creating child component `ProductAlertsComponent` that can receive data from its parents component `ProductListComponent`

1. run in terminal to create new component
   - `ng generate component product-alerts`
2. in `product-alerts.component`
   - `@Component()` decorator indicates the class is a component
   - it provides component meta data (selector, templates, styles) 
   - Key features of the `@Component` decorator
     - the selector identifies the component in html
     - template and style filename references html and css
     - it also exports the class `ProductAlertsComponents` which handles functionality
3. to setup `ProductAlertsComponents` to receive product data, import `Input` from angular core
4. Inside the class, define `product` property with `@Input` decorator
   - indicates that the property value is passed on from its parents
5. now changing `product-alerts.component.html` to add a button if price > 700
6. the generator would automatically add `ProductAlertComponent` to the `AppModule` so its available to other components
7. to display the component as a child, add the `<app-product-alert>` element to `product-list.component.html`, pass the current product as input using property binding

## pass data to parent component 

to make notify me button functional, the child component needs to notify and pass data to the parents component.
`ProductAlertsComponent` needs to emit an event when the user clicks and `ProductListComponent` needs to response

1. in `product-alerts.component.ts`, import `Output` and `EventEmitter` from core
2. in component class define a property `notify` with `@Output()` and an instance of `EventEmitter()`
   - configuring `ProductAlertComponent` with an `@Output()` allows it to emit an event when the value of `notify` changes
3. update the **Notify me** button with event binding to `notify.emit()` method
4. define what happens when user click the button
   - in the parent define `onNotify()` method
5. update `ProductListComponent` to receive data via the notify event

## next go

So now youve learned about an app that iterates through data and features components that communicate with each other
